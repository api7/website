  "home-text32": "We have been using Nginx internally as a proxy layer for intranet calls. Nginx has high performance, but a small number of requests fail when we modify the configuration and reload. In addition, Lua is used to implement specific scenarios, and native Lua affects the Nginx event handling mechanism, further slowing down the response time. In this context, we investigated Apache APISIX, a cloud-native, high-performance, scalable microservices API gateway. It not only has friendly support for native Nginx features, but also inherits the high concurrency, high performance, and high reliability of Nginx, and provides rich plugins such as grayscale, rate limiting, and authorized authentication to better serve the business. is a very good choice for gateway selection.",
  "home-text33": "Mobile applications, enterprise interconnection, and the Internet of Things have expanded the objects supported by backend services from the former single Web application to multiple usage scenarios, which not only increases the access pressure of backend services, but also increases the complexity of backend services. API gateway is exactly a suitable solution: it has the basic functions of request forwarding, protocol conversion, routing, etc., as well as high performance and stability, the gateway is also scalable and can be continuously enhanced. We investigated many API gateways and finally chose Apache APISIX as the core component of the next generation API gateway because of its high performance, high scalability, and active community. I hope this project will grow even more in the near future and have a more profound impact on the microservices space.",

We've implemented an Apache APISIX-based API gateway and have made a smooth transition to multi-cloud and microservices architectures thanks to APISIX's highly optimized and scalable platform and the support of our developer community!",
  "home-text35": "As microservices grow in popularity, the size of applications, the number of nodes and dependencies are growing rapidly, and the need for efficient and flexible cloud-native API gateways is growing stronger. We have been following and contributing to Apache APISIX since its first release, and our team members have been elected as Committers for the project. We believe more companies and individuals will join in and make the community more prosperous.",
