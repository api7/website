**Editor's Note: The extraordinary year 2020 has accelerated the digital transformation of global enterprises, of which cloud-native has become a key driver. Zhiliu Technology is partnering with Geely to enable centralized management, visualization, and security of APIs, laying the foundation for Geely's next '10 million vehicles' era.**

In 2020, global enterprises were accelerating their digital transformation, and business models are being transformed. All industries are following the trend to optimize processes, improve the way they work, boost productivity and inspire innovation. Digital technologies are being integrated into all areas of the enterprise, comprehensively disrupting old ways of collaboration, increasing efficiency, inspiring drivers, and assisting companies in exploring new models and discovering new value.

## Technology innovation for business growth

On 10 August, the 2020 Fortune 500 was announced, and Geely Holdings Group was ranked 243rd with revenue of US$47.8 billion (approximately RMB 330.8 billion).

This is the ninth consecutive year that Geely Holdings has been ranked in the Fortune 500 and the only Chinese private automotive group on the list. Since Geely Holding Group acquired Volvo Cars, Geely and Volvo have strengthened their cooperation in the areas of research and development, procurement, powertrain, and manufacturing, achieving fruitful results and laying a solid foundation for the sustainable and healthy development of both companies, as well as becoming a model of synergistic development in the industry.

In 2019, the cumulative sales of Geely Holdings' brands exceeded 2.17 million units. For the third consecutive year, it was the top-selling Chinese brand passenger car; global sales reached a new sales record for the sixth consecutive year.

Geely's rapid development is due to continuous technological innovation. The current technological innovations represented by 5G, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud-native are driving the digital transformation of the automotive industry. Geely has taken the initiative to meet the challenges and seize the historical opportunities in recent years, insisting on the high level of investment in R&D innovation, with over 100 billion dollars in R&D in ten years, driving technological transformation with R&D innovation and continuing to lead the technological transformation of Chinese brand cars.

## API helps digital transformation

Behind the Group's high business growth is Geely's solid information technology construction. At present, Geely Automobile Group has thousands of business systems, and the number of interfaces has increased with each passing day. How to manage the existing systems in a unified and efficient manner and how to open up the interfaces to provide greater value to the outside world are the main issues currently faced.

The traditional approach is to partially interface between projects according to their own needs, which makes the interfaces very specific and not generic enough to support new needs. This peer-to-peer approach, while utilizing APIs, does not create an API ecosystem. It often results in duplication of design and redevelopment, lengthening the project.

Geely Group has chosen to integrate mature API to improve efficiency and has changed the way it interfaces by opening up API and breaking through the limitations of the company's old systems. The traditional peer-to-peer docking has evolved into self-service docking. It is turning API into platforms and marketplaces.

A marketplace that hosts a large number of the Group's API requires a robust, secure, and reliable API gateway. The APISEVEN high-performance (Cloud Native API Gateway) developed by Zhiliu Technology offers fine-grained routing, full dynamic update capabilities, and performance that is far ahead of its peers, with in-depth support for all types of protection in terms of security, user-friendly operation and maintenance, detailed documentation, plus low-threshold customizable capabilities to gain Geely's favor.

## Simple, efficient, and undaunted by challenges

APISEVEN is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway based on the Apache Foundation's top-tier project, APISIX, offering rich traffic management features such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, greyscale publishing, service meltdown, authentication, observability, and more.

APISEVEN gateways have separate data and control planes so that the configuration of the control plane and the service traffic on the data plane does not affect each other, and the configuration is dynamically synchronized.

APISEVEN defaults to a highly available architecture, based on ETCD clusters for storage and distribution, with stateless management, horizontal scalability, and no single point of failure.

APISEVEN supports fine-grained control of business traffic, not only being able to differentiate traffic with different characteristics during the route matching phase but also to send a specified percentage of traffic to the back-end services based on custom rules.

For example, the Gili API market needs to differentiate traffic distribution under different versions of the same API, and after identifying a specific version of the API, it still needs to control traffic granularity to a specified copy. APISEVEN gateway supports the free combination of rules at different matching stages to meet various complex grayscale requirements.

Specific greyscale control policies include Canary, Blue-Green, AB testing, etc. Meet the daily multi-version deployment and specific traffic control needs of Gili. Plus, a number of interfaces are designed to make everyday use easier.

To ensure the normal operation of the API marketplace and reduce the impact of abnormal traffic on the API marketplace, APISEVEN provides cluster-level flow restrictions, which can be freely configured at the granularity of cluster, service, consumer, etc.

Operationally friendly, APISEVEN supports Prometheus, SkyWalking dynamic tracking, traffic replication, fault injection, and more.

These features of the APISEVEN gateway fit perfectly with the needs of the Geely API market, with centralized configuration and unified management of in-house APIs, along with multi-version management and permission control, enabling developers to quickly bring services and APIs online, making it easy for users to subscribe to services of interest. This allows developers to quickly bring services and API online and allow users to subscribe to interest services. The ability to quickly change configurations without affecting the normal operation of business traffic reduces development and subscription costs.

## Geely and Zhiliu Technology join forces to create the future

The APISEVEN (Cloud Native API Gateway) developed by Shenzhen Zhiliu Technology is designed to help enterprises and organizations build and run loosely coupled systems that are elastic and scalable, fault-tolerant, easy to manage, and easy to observe in new dynamic environments such as public, private and hybrid clouds. Combined with reliable automation, this enables developers to make frequent and predictable changes to their systems easily.

Against the backdrop of digital transformation, Geely, guided by its vision of "Let's fill the world with Geely", is practicing its internal strengths, putting the user at the center, driving China's manufacturing industry into the API economy, transforming into a technology-based enterprise and reshaping the global manufacturing landscape. Zhiliu Technology will use its technical strengths and expertise to help Geely Group lay the foundation for the next "10 million vehicles" and let customers feel the quality charm of Geely Made in China.
